/*
 * The data type |struct pdu| represents a single PDU as transfered
 * over an I/O channel. A PDU has the following format
 *
 *    |    1    |    1    |        2       |    n    |
 *    | service |  opcode | payload length | payload |
 *
 * Each PDU consists of a 4-byte header with service, opcode, and
 * payload length; and a variable-length data buffer. The service
 * describes the module and opcode describes the operation of the
 * service. The payload length contains the number of valid data
 * bytes in the payload.
 *
 * The PDU is based on the format of the BlueZ HAL protocol, which
 * is defined at
 *
 *    https://git.kernel.org/cgit/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/android/hal-ipc-api.txt
 *
 * A PDU can be initialized with a call to |init_pdu|. Payload is
 * read and written with |read_pdu_at|, |write_pdu_at|, and
 * |append_to_pdu|. The latter will automatically update the length
 * field in the PDU header.
 *
 * Similar to |scanf| and |printf|, the types of the marshalled data
 * is described by format-string characters. The types are
 *
 *      Character |   Type
 *    ------------+-----------------
 *        'c'     | signed 8 bit
 *        'C'     | unsigned 8 bit
 *        's'     | signed 16 bit
 *        'S'     | unsigned 16 bit
 *        'i'     | signed 32 bit
 *        'I'     | unsigned 32 bit
 *        'l'     | signed 64 bit
 *        'L'     | unsigned 64 bit
 *        'm'     | raw memory
 *        'M'     | raw memory
 *        '0'     | raw 0-terminated memory
 *
 * The characters 'm' and 'M' require pointers to the raw memory and the
 * length of the memory block in bytes given as a |size_t|. Capital |M|
 * will allocate the required memory automatically when reading from the
 * PDU. The caller is responsible for freeing the memory with |free|.
